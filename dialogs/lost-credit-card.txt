IVA: Hi, you’ve reached the Card Services virtual assistant. How can I help you today?

Caller:10: (slightly panicked) Hi, um—hi, I think my credit card’s been stolen. I just got to a coffee shop and it’s not in my wallet.

IVA: I’m really sorry to hear that. Let’s get your card locked right away. For security, I’ll need to confirm your identity first. Can you please tell me your account PIN?

Caller:8: (raising voice slightly) Yeah—it’s 2-9-8-3.

IVA: I caught “2 9”… but could you repeat the last part? There’s a lot of background noise.

Caller:5: (louder) 8-3!

IVA: I’m still having trouble hearing clearly—looks like there’s too much noise around you. No problem, though. I’ll send a secure text message to the number you’re calling from. Please verify your identity there, and we’ll lock your card and send a replacement right away.

Caller:5: Okay, thank you.
