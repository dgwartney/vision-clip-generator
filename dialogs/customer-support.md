**Agent:** Hello, this is Nova from Acme Support. How can I assist you today?

**User:** Hi Nova, I received the wrong item in my order.

**Agent:** I’m sorry to hear that! Could you tell me your order number so I can take a look?

**User:** Sure, it’s 12345.

**Agent:** Thank you. I see that the wrong size was sent. I’ll arrange a replacement right away. You’ll get a return label by email—does that work for you?

**User:** Yes, that’s perfect. Thanks for your help!

**Agent:** You’re very welcome. Have a great day!
