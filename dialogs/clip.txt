IVA: Thank you for calling.  I'm your Alaska Airlines virtual assistant.  How can I help you today?

Caller:7: I’m trying to book these tickets online, but it’s not letting me use award travel and my companion certificate.

IVA: I’m sorry to hear you are having problems booking your tickets.

IVA: Are you trying to use a companion certificate combined with an award travel ticket?

Caller:2: Yes

IVA: Unfortunately, the companion fare code is only valid for use when traveling with a guest on a paid published coach airfare. Do you want to look into your alternatives?

Caller:4: Yeah, let's do that.

IVA: OK, let’s take a look.  What is your mileage plan number?

Caller:7: Um, sure. it's uh 576 551 268

IVA: Got it.  One moment while I look up your account.

IVA: OK. And for extra security, what’s the billing zip code?

Caller:4: Sure, It's 98116

IVA: Thanks Ben
