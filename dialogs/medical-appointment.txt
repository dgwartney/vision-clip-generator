Caller:10: Hi, I need to reschedule my appointment. It’s supposed to be next Monday morning. I also forgot what the instructions were to prepare for it.

IVA: No problem, let's start by rescheduling your appointment first. I can help with that. Can I first confirm your identity by asking you for your birthday?

Caller:3: 1/1/91

IVA: Thanks, Sam. I've found your appointment on file. What day works better for you?

Caller:5: Maybe Thursday instead?

IVA: I have a 10:30 AM slot or 2:45 PM on Thursday. Which one would you like?

Caller:5: Uhm, 10:30 AM on Thursday is good.

IVA: Sure! I can make that change for you. Now, for your bloodwork, please fast for 8 hours and bring a photo ID. Would you like me to text these instructions to you?

Caller:5: Yes, that’d be great.

IVA: Done. I’ve sent your new appointment details and prep instructions by text. Anything else I can do for you today?

Caller:5: Nope, that’s it. Thanks!

IVA: You’re all set—see you Thursday!
