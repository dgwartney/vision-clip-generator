IVA: Good morning, you’ve reached Willow Creek Hospital. I’m the virtual assistant. How can I assist you today?

Caller:10: Hi, I need to reschedule my appointment. It’s supposed to be next Monday morning. I also forgot what I need to do to get ready for it.

IVA: Sure thing! I can help with that. 

IVA: Let’s start by rescheduling your appointment — can I just confirm your date of birth first?

Caller:8: 1/1/91

IVA: Thanks, Sam. I’ve got your appointment here.

IVA: What day would work better for you?

Caller:8: Maybe Thursday instead?

IVA: I have a 10:30 AM slot or 2:45 PM on Thursday. Which one would you like?

Caller:8: Uhm, 10:30 AM on Thursday is good.

IVA: Perfect, I’ll get that updated for you.

IVA: Now, just a reminder — since this is for bloodwork, you’ll need to fast for 8 hours. And as always bring a photo ID.

IVA: Would you like me to text those instructions to you?

Caller:5: Yes, that’d be great.

IVA: Great! I’ve sent your new appointment and prep details by text.

IVA: Anything else I can do for you today?

Caller:10: I am not sure where you are located?

IVA: We’re located at 4820 Willowbend Drive, Riverview, OH 44128, right across from the Riverview Community Park.

IVA: Would you like me to text that address and our directions to you?

Caller:8: Sure, that would help a lot

<text-received>

IVA: All set — I’ve just sent the details to your phone.

IVA: Anything else I can do for you today?

Caller:8: Nope, that’s it. Thanks!

IVA: All set! Thanks for calling, and we’ll see you Thursday morning.
