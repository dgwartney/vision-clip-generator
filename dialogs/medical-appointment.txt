IVA: Good morning, you’ve reached HarborPoint Diagnostics. I’m the virtual assistant. How can I assist you today?

Caller:18: Hi, I need to reschedule my appointment. It’s supposed to be next Monday morning. I also forgot what I need to do to get ready for it and which location I pickeded?

IVA: Sure thing! I can help with that. 

IVA: Let’s start by rescheduling your appointment — can I just confirm your date of birth first?

Caller:8: 1/1/91

IVA: Thanks, Sam. I’ve got your appointment here.

IVA: What day would work better for you?

Caller:8: Maybe Thursday instead?

IVA: I have a 10:30 AM slot or 2:45 PM on Thursday. Which one would you like?

Caller:8: Uhm, 10:30 AM on Thursday is good.

IVA: Perfect, I’ll get that updated for you.

IVA: Now, just a reminder — since this is for bloodwork, you’ll need to fast for 8 hours. And as always bring a photo ID.

IVA: Would you like me to text those instructions with our address and directions to you?

Caller:5: Yes, that’d be great.

<text-received>

IVA: Great! I’ve sent your new appointment, prep details, along with our address and directions by text.

IVA: Anything else I can do for you today?

Caller:8: Nope, that’s it. Thanks!

IVA: All set! Thanks for calling, and we’ll see you Thursday morning.
